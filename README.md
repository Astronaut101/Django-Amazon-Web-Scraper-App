# Amazon-Scraper-Django-App

A web application that scrapes amazon product items and categorizes them all together for monitoring and price tracking. This is based from the [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgjw1dR712jqjwhvA2V6_DTVVKou_HHlW) by python django youtuber pyplane.

This is built upon using [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) principles as a practice for building effective applications as a service and deploying it securely from development, test, and production phases.
